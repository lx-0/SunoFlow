> Follow-up (2026-06-09): **Inspire generation basis fixed** (commit `7cdc2b7b`). The full link-followed RSS article (already fetched into `RssItem.content`) was being thrown away by every downstream consumer, so song generation ran off a single sentence (title + mood + topics). Both Inspire paths now pass the whole article as the lyrics basis; lyrics caps raised (basis 2000→6000, lyrics field 3000→5000). **Two truncation levers still open by design** — promote to a task if the partial-article complaint recurs: (1) `CONTENT_THRESHOLD = 200` in `src/lib/rss/index.ts` only follows the link for very short / read-more-marked inline bodies, so feeds inlining a medium partial body never get the full article; (2) the auto-generate cron path (`buildSimplePromptFromItem`) still slices the body to 1500 chars. Fix is **runtime-unverified** (typecheck + unit only) — needs a live Inspire→Generate pass against a real feed.

### Milestone 7: Suno Account Integration (COMPLETE)

**Status:** Done
**Delivered:** 2026-03-24
**Parent issue:** SUNAA-191

Connect directly to suno.com accounts to browse and import existing songs.

| Deliverable | Issue | Status | Priority |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|

### Milestone 8: Production Hardening (IN PROGRESS)

**Status:** Active
**Target:** 2026-03-31

Security audits, performance optimization, and production-readiness work.

| Deliverable | Issue | Status | Priority |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| API route authentication coverage audit | SUNAA-217 | In Progress | Critical |
| Input validation, CSRF, rate limiting review | SUNAA-218 | Todo | Critical |
| Production environment config (env vars, secrets, migrations) | SUNAA-216 | Todo | Critical |
| Critical path test coverage (auth, generation, credits) | SUNAA-219 | Todo | High |
| Database & API performance optimization | SUNAA-220 | Todo | High |
| Frontend bundle & asset optimization | SUNAA-221 | Todo | High |
| Monitoring & observability (Sentry, structured logging) | SUNAA-222 | Todo | Medium |

### Milestone 9: Growth & Scale (PLANNED)

**Status:** Backlog
**Target:** TBD

Features for internationalization, social engagement, and operational maturity.

| Deliverable | Issue | Status | Priority |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Internationalization (i18n) — next-intl | SUNAA-184 | Backlog | Low |
| Social features — comments, follows, activity feed | SUNAA-185 | Backlog | Low |
| Song recommendations — similar, 'also liked', daily mix | SUNAA-186 | Backlog | Low |
| CDN for audio assets | SUNAA-188 | Backlog | Low |
| API versioning (/api/v1/) | SUNAA-189 | Backlog | Low |

> Note (2026-06-05): "Social features — comments, follows, activity feed" and "Song recommendations — daily mix" are listed Backlog here, but the code already ships large portions of both: `/feed` social feed, `Follow` model, public profiles `/u/[handle]`, auto-generated playlists ("Your Top Hits", "New This Week", "Mood: Chill"), and the `/discover` + `/explore` + `/radio` + `/inspire` discovery cluster. This is the same gap PRODUCT.md surfaces from the opposite angle: PRODUCT.md says SunoFlow is not a feed/recommendation product, yet the code is. Either the roadmap promotes these from Backlog and PRODUCT.md changes, or the cluster gets removed and PRODUCT.md holds. See `JOURNEYS.md` finding 5 + Decision Log entries 2026-06-05.

### Milestone 10: Design System & UX Baseline (PROPOSED)

**Status:** Awaiting CEO approval
**Target:** TBD
**Why:** Brand identity (PRODUCT.md) + visual system (DESIGN.md) + as-is UX audit (JOURNEYS.md) all landed 2026-06-05 as agent-readable docs. Code does not match the new spec. Migration scope is the whole app. Strategic gap (3-modes claim vs 20-route reality) is not a design fix; it is a product decision.

| Deliverable | Issue | Status | Priority |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Resolve mode-model: keep 3 modes (Browse/Generate/Edit) and remove Discovery cluster + auto-playlists + unlock Mashup, OR expand PRODUCT.md to 6 modes (Browse/Generate/Edit/Discover/Social/Meta) | — | Open decision | Critical |
| Write `UX.md` (living spec) after mode decision | — | Blocked on above | High |
| Fix `/library` empty-state (currently renders "Failed to load library" error for fresh users) | — | Todo | Critical |
| Hide Sentry/GlitchTip "Issues" overlay in production | — | Todo | High |
| Consolidate two app shells (Shell A: no top bar / Shell B: top bar) to one | — | Todo | High |
| Rename Template / Preset / Style Template / Saved Style to one canonical term in the generate form | — | Todo | Medium |
| Visual migration: replace 1049 inline `bg-violet-*` / `text-violet-*` utility usages with magenta tokens; remove `font-family: Arial` fallback in `globals.css` | — | Todo (migrate-on-touch) | Medium |
| Light-theme strategy: confirm dark-first default, ship light as second-class fallback or drop | — | Open decision | Medium |

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 2026-03-20 | Next.js 14 + Prisma + PostgreSQL | Full-stack TypeScript, fast iteration, Railway-ready |
| 2026-03-21 | Mobile-first design | Primary use case is quick music generation on the go |
| 2026-03-22 | Railway for hosting | Simple Docker deploy, built-in PostgreSQL, auto-SSL |
| 2026-03-23 | 4-phase enhancement plan | Systematic improvement covering security → features → quality → growth |
| 2026-03-23 | Suno account integration | Users want to import their existing Suno library, not start fresh |
| 2026-03-24 | Phase 3 + Suno integration as parallel milestones | Quality work and Suno import are independent tracks |
| 2026-03-24 | Milestones 6+7 complete, Milestone 8 = Production Hardening | Security, perf, and monitoring before v1.0 launch |
| 2026-05-15 | Error backend = self-hosted GlitchTip, not Sentry SaaS | Sentry-protocol-compatible for error + performance envelopes. Replay envelopes rejected — `replayIntegration()` removed from `sentry.client.config.ts`. Trace sampling kept at 10%. DSN-driven; CSP origin derived from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` so the ingest host stays out of source. |
| 2026-05-15 | SunoFlow shipped as a Claude Code plugin | Added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at repo root; existing `skills/sunoflow/SKILL.md` becomes the bundled skill. Installable via `/plugin install sunoflow@yesterday-public-plugins`. No MCP auto-wired in the plugin (stdio server needs repo checkout + env). |
| 2026-05-15 | SunoFlow listed in Yesterday public plugin marketplace + transitive dep of `personal-agent` bundle | Adds the SunoFlow MCP skill to anyone installing the `personal-agent` agent-core bundle. Update both catalog README and bundle README in same change going forward. |
| 2026-05-15 | GlitchTip MCP integration kept in a private operator plugin | The agent-facing triage skill is bundled in a private operator plugin alongside an auto-starting HTTP MCP server. Not part of the public SunoFlow plugin because it points at an operator-specific GlitchTip instance. |
| 2026-05-15 | Admin grant via `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var, OR-merged with DB `User.isAdmin` | Removes hardcoded operator emails from migrations + scripts (public-repo hygiene). Bootstraps operator access on fresh DBs without touching the `User` table. Comma-separated, case-insensitive. Helper in `src/lib/auth/admin.ts`; OR-merged in both the NextAuth jwt callback (`src/lib/auth/session.ts`) AND `requireAdmin()` (`src/lib/auth/index.ts`) — both paths must check, otherwise the env grant works for JWT-derived UI guards but not for `adminRoute()`-protected APIs. |
| 2026-05-15 | Dockerfile declares `ARG NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for build-time inlining | Next.js inlines `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` into the client bundle AND bakes `headers()` results into the routes manifest at build time. Railway forwards service env vars to Dockerfile `RUN` only when the Dockerfile declares them as `ARG`. Without this, the Sentry DSN was empty at build, the CSP was missing the GlitchTip origin, and client envelopes were CSP-blocked. |
| 2026-05-15 | Active-user metrics use `Activity` ∪ `PlayHistory`, not `User.lastLoginAt` | NextAuth `session.strategy="jwt"` writes `lastLoginAt` only on fresh sign-in. With the default 30d JWT TTL, an active user with a valid token appears inactive for up to a month. New helper `src/lib/active-users` UNIONs `Activity.createdAt` and `PlayHistory.playedAt`; admin metrics, analytics dashboard, hourly snapshot, and email-digest targeting all switched. `User.lastLoginAt` retained as "last sign-in" for display. |
| 2026-05-15 | Streak triggers fire on play and favorite, not only generation | `recordDailyActivity` was only called from `song-completion` so the streak counter froze when users were listening but not creating. Added triggers (with `checkStreakMilestones`) to `lib/history` (PlayHistory write) and `lib/songs/favorites` (addFavorite). Profile UI label "X days" now matches user expectation. |
| 2026-05-15 | Failed Songs are auto-archived at every failure write site | `archivedAt = now()` set in `markSongFailed`, `createSongRecord("failed")`, `cleanupStalePending`, and the two stream/status routes that mark orphaned songs failed. `markSongFailed` preserves any earlier user-set `archivedAt`. One-time backfill ran for 13 pre-existing rows across 3 users. Library listings stay clean. |
| 2026-05-15 | Daily `rate-limit-cleanup` job, `generate` action excluded | `RateLimitEntry` had no cleanup; only the read path filtered by 1h window so rows accumulated forever. Daily 02:30 UTC job deletes entries older than 7d. `generate` action skipped because `/api/dashboard/usage` reads it as a lifetime/30d generation history. Also cleans `AnonRateLimitEntry`. |
| 2026-05-15 | TanStack Query for all client list-views | Replaces 6+ hand-rolled `fetch + setState` sites in `LibraryView`, `HistoryView`, `RecentlyPlayed`, `useCredits` with `useInfiniteQuery` / `useQuery` behind `useSongsList`, `useTagsList`, `useRecentlyPlayed`. Mobile-first defaults: `staleTime 30s`, `gcTime 5min`, `networkMode "offlineFirst"`, retry skips 4xx. Eliminates stale-fetch-overwrites-fresh races on slow mobile networks; pending-poll lives behind `refetchInterval` only while pages contain pending songs. Optimistic mutations stay in local component state for now (cache reshape deferred). |
| 2026-05-15 | Singleton generation tracker, visibility-aware per-song SSE | `useGenerationPoller` is a thin React subscribe wrapper over module-level state in `src/lib/realtime/generation-tracker.ts` (mirrors `events-stream.ts`). Tracking survives component remounts (navigating away from `GenerateForm` no longer drops in-flight song tracking), per-song EventSources close on `visibilitychange=hidden` and reopen on resume, and duplicate songIds across components share one connection. Server-side per-job stream still drives `pollToCompletion` — preserves Suno-polling fallback. |
| 2026-05-15 | Waveform peak math runs in a Web Worker | `src/lib/audio/peaks.ts` + `peaks-worker.ts` extract decode + reduction loop from `PlayerWaveform.tsx`. Decode stays main-thread (browser-internal off-thread), but the O(samples) for-loop iterating ~8M Float32s now transfers (not copies) the channel buffer to a worker. LRU cache (50 entries) + per-songId in-flight map. Cover swipe on mobile no longer stalls UI 100–500ms per song. |
| 2026-05-15 | Load-generation token guards five async audio paths in `QueueContext` | `loadGenerationRef` increments on every transition that loads a new src. `playable-versions` fetch, deferred `canplay` fallback, CDN-error refresh fetch, `radioRefill` `fetchRadioSongs`, and `loadPlaybackState` restore + its position-seek `canplay` handler all capture the generation at dispatch and bail on resolve if it changed. Eliminates "song flips back to previous" and "playback rewinds to stale position" symptoms on slow mobile networks. |
| 2026-05-15 | PostHog analytics init deferred to `requestIdleCallback` | `pageView` / `track` are no-ops until `initAnalytics()` resolves, so the only observable change is that the very first page view fires a couple hundred ms later. Reclaims first-interactive-paint time on 3G. Safari fallback to `setTimeout(..., 1)`; 4s timeout ensures init eventually runs. |
| 2026-05-15 | `instrumentation.ts` initializes Sentry per runtime + exports `onRequestError` | `@sentry/nextjs` 10+ no longer auto-runs `sentry.{server,edge}.config.ts`. Without an explicit `await import` per `NEXT_RUNTIME` they never executed and 100% of server-side errors silently bypassed Sentry/GlitchTip. Next.js 15's `onRequestError` re-export wires RSC + Route Handler errors. `logServerError` now mirrors every entry into `Sentry.captureException` with tags + extras matching its pino entry — fixes the ~50 API routes whose structured error path was previously invisible to tracking. |
| 2026-05-15 | Service worker cache namespaces are per-deploy via `?v=<commit-sha>` | `ServiceWorkerRegistrar` registers `/sw.js?v=${NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID}`. Browser treats each unique URL as a new SW → install → activate → keepCaches drops every prior namespace. Replaces manual `sunoflow-static-v1`/`v2`/… bumps that nobody remembered. SW reads `self.location.search` for the version. `AUDIO_CACHE` stays stable across deploys (it holds user-saved offline songs, not deploy-coupled bundles). |
| 2026-05-15 | Smarter SW update UX: periodic check + safe auto-reload countdown | `setInterval(registration.update(), 60_000)` catches deploys for long-running PWA sessions without waiting for the browser's 24h background recheck. On `controllerchange`: if audio is playing, show non-dismissive banner (reload would interrupt music); otherwise countdown 5s and auto-reload with cancel button. No more stranded users on week-old bundles. |
| 2026-05-15 | `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID` and `SENTRY_RELEASE` set explicitly in deploy workflow | `railway up` uploads a tarball, so Railway never auto-populates `RAILWAY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`. Both vars are now `railway variable set` from `${{ inputs.sha \|\| github.sha }}` with `--skip-deploys` before `railway up`. Dockerfile declares matching `ARG` + `ENV` so the build container sees them. Side-effect fix: Sentry releases were never commit-tagged before, breaking source-map issue grouping. |
| 2026-05-15 | Generation failures get reported to GlitchTip from every write site | All three terminal-failure paths used to flip `generationStatus="failed"` without ever notifying error tracking: `handleSongFailure` (Suno-reported failure / timeout), `cleanupStalePending` (bulk 15-min stale sweep), and the `pollCount > MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS` branch in `/api/songs/[id]/status`. Prod DB had 21 silent failures across 3 buckets (14× "Generation timed out" with `pollCount=0` from the stale sweep, 5× Suno "Internal Error", 2× content-policy rejects). `handleSongFailure` now `logServerError("song-generation-failed", ...)` with a small heuristic suppressing user-content rejects (artist name / content policy / copyright). `cleanupStalePending` switched from bulk-`updateMany` to select-then-update-then-log-per-row so each stale-timeout surfaces individually with `songId/sunoJobId/pollCount/ageMs`. Cluster-of-timeouts now visible in GlitchTip — likely indicator of server-restart-during-generation. |
| 2026-05-16 | **0.2.0 release** — stuck-pending root-cause + 7 architecture refactors + skill restructure | Triaged GlitchTip Issue 3. Two root causes: `cleanupStalePending` was a blind timeout discarding songs Suno had completed (replaced with `runStalePendingRecovery` re-probe + per-row isolation); `/api/generate/[jobId]/stream` bound `pollToCompletion` to `request.signal`, killing the poller on tab-close while Suno still ran (decoupled — SSE is best-effort, poll runs to terminal). UI bug "regenerated song hidden from library" — `handleSongFailure` auto-archives, and three "back to ready" paths never cleared `archivedAt`; lifecycle now clears it on every ready/pending transition. Retry UI now merges response into local state + polls pending rows. 6 historical stuck-archived rows unarchived via direct SQL. Refactors: single `songs/lifecycle.ts` seam (5 sites → 1), `song-ready-events/` domain adapters (god-handler → 4 modules), `stale-pending-recovery.ts` (read/write split), `useTrackPendingSong` (consolidate 2 polling strategies), queue API cleanup (`addItem` single seam, `updateItem` split), `notifications/channels.ts` typed registry, `error-logger/{client,server}` split. Plus error-logger tag-promotion (songId etc. surface in GlitchTip MCP). Skill restructured per Anthropic best practices: 345-line monolith → 111-line entrypoint + `reference/{tools,resources}.md` (progressive disclosure, third-person `description` + `when_to_use`, comprehensive variation examples for every tool). Marketplace description synced in `lx-0/skills` repo. Tests 1270 passing / 47 skipped / 0 failed. |
| 2026-05-16 | **0.2.1 patch** — concurrent-handler race in `createAlternateSongs` | Three handlers can fire `handleSongSuccess` concurrently for the same parent song (SSE pollToCompletion, client status-poll, recovery sweep). Second one's `prisma.song.create` hit `@unique` on `Song.sunoJobId` → P2002. Two-layer fix: single-flight guard at top of `handleSongSuccess` (skip if already `ready` with same `sunoAudioId`) + P2002 catch in `createAlternateSongs` (look up by unique sunoJobId, return existing alternate). The single-flight guard is TOCTOU-racy by design — fast filter for the common case; the P2002 handler is the real backstop. Pre-existing bug, surfaced more often after 0.2.0's `runStalePendingRecovery` re-probe path. Plus the `yesterday-ai/cloud/skills/glitchtip-mcp` SKILL.md got a 4-criteria evidence-based resolution workflow with `update_issue(in_release=...)` pinning. |
| 2026-05-18 | **0.2.2 patch** — Railway port-leak, dual cover in player, upload route TS narrowing, expanded-player flex-starvation | (a) White-screen on first mobile visit: `next-intl` locale redirect emitted `Location: https://sunoflow.up.railway.app:8080/de` because Next.js standalone reads `req.headers.host` (Railway forwards internal `$PORT=8080`). Middleware now post-processes Location — if `x-forwarded-host` is set, rewrite self-host redirects to the canonical public origin with no port. Dev untouched. (b) Two cover thumbnails rendered in the bottom global player bar instead of one — the `md:hidden`/`hidden md:flex` mutual-exclusion via CSS was fragile (Tailwind purge / cache / Tailwind class race). Replaced with a single `<button>` whose onClick decides via `window.matchMedia("(min-width: 768px)")` between drawer-open and router.push — dual-render is now structurally impossible. (c) Build-blocking TS error in `src/app/api/upload/route.ts:90` from the prior `22ee71f` route-handler refactor: `fileUrl` typed as `string \| undefined` but used in a ternary where TS couldn't narrow. Restructured as if/else with unreachable throw. Surfaced because local typecheck ran pre-pull — new memory `feedback_post_pull_typecheck.md` to enforce post-pull re-typecheck. (d) ExpandedPlayer tab buttons (Lyrics / Up Next / EQ) toggled state but the panel rendered ~0px on mobile because all siblings were `flex-shrink-0` and the panel's `flex-1` had no available height — restructured into competing flex-1 regions with explicit mobile/desktop overflow split. Plus merged `fix/deploy-workflow-pnpm` (pnpm setup + dummy DB URL for migration-safety-check). |
| 2026-06-05 | **Brand + visual-system baseline as docs** — PRODUCT.md, DESIGN.md, `.impeccable/design.json` at project root | Captured the previously-implicit brand position. Register = `product`, dark-first, three-word personality *Playful · Vibrant · Disciplined*, north star *"The Late-Night Studio Console"*. Primary accent migrates from violet `#7c3aed` to Electric Magenta `oklch(62% 0.27 350)`. Tokens in OKLCH. Geist Sans + Geist Mono only; Mono reserved for user-authored content (lyrics, prompts, slugs, IDs). DESIGN.md follows Google Stitch format (YAML frontmatter tokens + 6 fixed sections). The 1049 inline `bg-violet-*` / `text-violet-*` utility usages + `font-family: Arial` fallback in `globals.css` are migration backlog, called out as Don'ts in DESIGN.md. No code changed; the docs are the artifact. Treat as target, migrate on touch. |
| 2026-06-05 | **As-is UX audit captured as JOURNEYS.md + reproducible Playwright recorder** | Live walkthrough on a fresh authed user + empty database, 32 screenshots (desktop 1440x900 + mobile 390x844), recorder at `/tmp/sunoflow-journey/journey.mjs`. Seven priority findings: (1) `/library` shows error UI instead of empty state for fresh users (worst first-minute friction); (2) Mashup is paywalled, contradicting PRODUCT.md's three-equal-modes claim; (3) two app shells coexist; (4) four overlapping names for one concept inside the generate form (Template / Preset / Style Template / Saved Style); (5) the Discovery cluster (`/discover` + `/explore` + `/feed` + `/radio` + `/inspire` + auto-generated playlists) implements exactly the recommendation-rail / "Made for you" pattern PRODUCT.md bans; (6) whole-app visual migration from light-violet to dark-magenta is pending; (7) the "three modes" model fits a five-route app, the product is a twenty-route app. JOURNEYS.md is a dated snapshot artifact; the living UX spec is not yet written. |
| 2026-06-05 | **UX-spec format chosen: hybrid YAML-metadata + Stitch 6-section markdown body, name `UX.md`** | Researched the agentic-engineering doc landscape (web-search) and the local ytstack idiom (skill inspection). Picked hybrid: ytstack-style frontmatter (`name`, `created`, `updated`, `status`, `modes[]`) for queryable metadata + Stitch-style fixed section order (Modes / Screens / States / Journeys / Transitions / Empty-States) for predictable structure + Mermaid + tables as structured escape-hatches inside prose-first sections. UX.md will be the third strategic doc at the project root, sibling to PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md. JOURNEYS.md stays as audit-snapshot type, UX.md is the living spec. **Not yet written:** mode-model decision (3 modes or 6) blocks UX.md authorship, since writing it now would cement the unresolved gap. |
| 2026-06-07 | **Native app navigation rework (M004)** — fixed tree, switch-not-stack, singleton player, global chrome | User reported no fixed nav tree (every nav pushed a view, Back walked a growing stack) + the player opening multiple times. Reworked to a native music-app model in `apps/mobile/src/navigation.ts`: `switchTo`/`goToSection` collapse to the home base (`dismissAll`→`navigate`) so sections never stack; `openPlayer` uses `navigate` so the modal can't duplicate (was 21 `push("/player")`). Bottom tab bar + mini-player moved to the root layout (`GlobalChrome`), persistent everywhere, hidden on login/player. Bottom-right tab → Profile (stats atop profile). Spec + call-site audit in `apps/mobile/NAVIGATION.md`. Side-effect: every scrollable screen now needs `MINIPLAYER_CLEARANCE` (16 fixed). Code-complete, UNTESTED on device. |
| 2026-06-07 | **Native song-detail PWA parity + UI polish + animation skills** | Song detail audited field-by-field vs web `SongDetailView`: the Suno **style** prompt (`tags` string) was never rendered — now a labeled metadata card; tags card shows real custom `SongTags`; added thumbs feedback, add-to-playlist, variation link. Consistent UI/UX polish across ~35 screens (shared EmptyState/cards/inputs/clearance). Animation stack (Reanimated 4 + worklets + gesture-handler, New Arch) is installed but unwired (no babel worklets plugin); Software Mansion `react-native-best-practices` + Expo `building-native-ui` skills vendored in `.claude/skills/`. Web-only features deliberately not ported (embed, offline cache, AI cover-gen, moderation appeal, lyrics annotations). |
