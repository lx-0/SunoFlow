# SunoFlow

Generate and manage AI music through the SunoFlow MCP server.

## Setup

1. Get an API key from your SunoFlow account: **Settings > API Keys**.
2. Start the MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sunoflow": {
      "command": "tsx",
      "args": ["mcp/server.ts"],
      "env": {
        "SUNOFLOW_API_KEY": "sk-your-key-here",
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The server also needs `DATABASE_URL` pointing to the SunoFlow Postgres database.

## Tools

### Song generation

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `generate_song` | Create a new song from a prompt or custom lyrics/style/title. Returns a song ID — poll `get_song` until `generationStatus === "ready"`. Generates 2 songs per request. |
| `extend_song` | Continue an existing song from a given point. Creates a new variation linked to the original. |
| `generate_lyrics` | Generate song lyrics from a text description. Returns a task ID for polling. |
| `generate_sounds` | Generate ambient sounds or SFX from a text prompt. Supports looping, BPM, and musical key control. |
| `boost_style` | Expand a short style description (e.g. "chill lofi") into a detailed style prompt for more precise generation. |

### Library management

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_songs` | Browse the song library with optional genre, mood, and status filters. Paginated. |
| `get_song` | Get full song details: audio URL, metadata, lyrics, generation status. Also used for polling pending generations. |
| `create_playlist` | Create a new playlist (max 50 per user). |
| `add_to_playlist` | Add a song to an existing playlist (max 500 songs per playlist). |

### Audio processing

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `separate_vocals` | Split a song into vocal + instrumental tracks, or full multi-stem separation (drums, bass, guitar, etc.). |
| `convert_to_wav` | Convert a generated song to lossless WAV format. |
| `generate_midi` | Extract MIDI data with instrument tracks and note-level detail. |

### Visual & video

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `create_music_video` | Generate an MP4 music video with synchronized visuals. Retained 15 days. |
| `generate_cover_image` | Generate 2 AI cover art images for a song. Retained 14 days. |

### Utility

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sunoflow_info` | Server version and list of all registered tools. |
| `get_credits` | Check remaining monthly generation credits. |

## Resources

The server exposes MCP resources for direct data access:

- `sunoflow://songs` — recent songs list
- `sunoflow://songs/{id}` — single song detail
- `sunoflow://playlists` — user playlists
- `sunoflow://playlists/{id}` — playlist with tracks
- `sunoflow://feed` — discovery feed
- `sunoflow://stats/credits` — credit usage summary

## Workflow: generate a song

1. (Optional) Call `boost_style` to expand a short genre tag into a rich style prompt.
2. Call `generate_song` with your prompt, title, and style. Note the returned `songId`.
3. Poll `get_song` with that `songId` until `generationStatus === "ready"`.
4. Optionally call `extend_song` to continue the track, `generate_cover_image` for artwork, or `create_music_video` for video.

## Workflow: stem separation for remixing

1. Use `list_songs` or `get_song` to find the target song (must be status `"ready"`).
2. Call `separate_vocals` with `type: "split_stem"` for full multi-stem output (drums, bass, guitar, keyboard, percussion, strings, synth, fx, brass, woodwinds).
3. Poll the returned task ID until processing completes.

## Credits

Most operations consume credits. Check `get_credits` before bulk operations.

| Operation | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Song generation | 10 credits |
| Song extension | 10 credits |
| Lyrics generation | 2 credits |
| Style boost | 5 credits |
| Vocal separation | 10 credits |
| Full stem split | 50 credits |

## Model versions

`generate_song` and `extend_song` accept a `model` parameter: `V4`, `V4_5`, `V5`, `V5_5`. V5_5 is the latest with best quality. Match the original model when extending a song.

## Custom mode

Setting `title` or `style` on `generate_song` enables custom mode where `prompt` is treated as literal lyrics text rather than a free-form description. Use this when you have specific lyrics to set to music.
